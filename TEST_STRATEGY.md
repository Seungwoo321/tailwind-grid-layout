# Test Strategy for 100% Coverage

## Overview
This document outlines the test strategy for achieving 100% test coverage in the tailwind-grid-layout project, focusing on both unit tests and UI interaction tests for drag and resize functionality.

## Current State
- **Framework**: Vitest v3.2.3 with jsdom
- **Coverage**: 39.97% statements, 95.55% branches, 80.95% functions
- **Issues**: 3 failing tests preventing full coverage calculation

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Tests with Vitest (Primary)
- **Scope**: Component logic, utilities, state management
- **Tools**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: All synchronous behavior and component rendering

### 2. Browser Mode Tests with Vitest (For UI Interactions)
- **Scope**: Drag and drop, resize operations
- **Tools**: Vitest Browser Mode with Playwright provider
- **Coverage**: Complex user interactions that require real browser environment

### 3. Integration Strategy
We'll use a hybrid approach:
- Keep existing Vitest unit tests for fast feedback
- Add Vitest Browser Mode for drag/resize interactions
- Merge coverage reports using V8 provider

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests
1. Fix DroppableGridContainer dragLeave test
2. Fix GridContainer collision detection test
3. Fix ResponsiveGridContainer breakpoint test

### Phase 2: Configure Browser Mode
```typescript
// vitest.browser.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'playwright',
      enabled: true,
      name: 'chromium',
      headless: true
    }
  }
})
```

### Phase 3: Add Missing Tests
Components needing coverage:
- DroppableGridContainer (0% coverage)
- GridContainer (0% coverage)
- ResponsiveGridContainer (0% coverage)

### Phase 4: Browser Interaction Tests
Critical UI interactions to test:
1. Drag item to new position
2. Resize item by dragging handle
3. Drop external item into grid
4. Collision detection during drag
5. Responsive breakpoint changes

## Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 100% for all metrics
- **Excluded**: docs/, examples/, stories/, .storybook/, UI components, config files
- **Focus**: Core library components and utilities

## Test Organization
```
__tests__/
├── unit/           # Fast unit tests (existing)
├── browser/        # Browser-based interaction tests
└── integration/    # Full workflow tests
```

## CI/CD Integration
1. Run unit tests first (fast feedback)
2. Run browser tests in parallel
3. Merge coverage reports
4. Fail build if coverage < 100%

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- 100% coverage on included files
- Sub-second unit test execution
- < 30 second total test suite execution
